## How to contribute

- **Bugs and ideas**: open an issue. Security problems go through the private
  report described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), never a public issue.
- **Pull requests**: keep them focused, one topic per PR.

Before opening a pull request:

```sh
pre-commit install              # ruff, YAML/TOML checks and unit tests on each commit
pre-commit run --all-files
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Conventions:

- Python 3.11+ and the standard library only.
- Program output in English, coloured statuses (`ok`, `warn`, `ko`, `info`) through `seedbox/ui.py`.
- Shell snippets in docs stay portable (POSIX sh / bash), not tied to zsh.
- No real tracker names, release names or copyrighted titles in code, tests,
  docs or issues: use placeholders such as `tracker-a.example` or `Some.Entry`.
